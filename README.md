# Hello_World_Public_1
Just another public repository

//Making changes to the readme file in the branch: featurebranch_2

//Excercise: Simulating a situation where the changes are made to the feature branch and by the time the developer goes to the dev branch for merging, then there are already some existing changes in dev and so the developer has to rebase the dev branch code.
